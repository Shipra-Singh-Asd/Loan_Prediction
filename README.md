# Loan Prediction Using Logistic Regression Model

Loan prediction using logistic regression is a classic binary classification problem in machine learning. The goal is to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to be approved or rejected based on certain features or attributes.

**Train-Test Split:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the logistic regression model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

**Predictions**: Use the trained logistic regression model to predict the loan approval status for new loan applications or unseen data.
